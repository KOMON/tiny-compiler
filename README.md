Jack Crenshaw's compiler tutorial

This was a fun time I had my first year at PSU following along with Jack Crenshaw's [Let's Build a Compiler](https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/) series.

It's meant to compile a smallish language called "Tiger", and while the original tutorial was written for Pascal, I wrote this one in C.

I'm not quite sure how far I got looking back, I distinctly remember getting a little over half way before exams picked up and I lost interest.

I encourage anybody who's interested to check out that tutorial though, a nice little bit of practical compiler basics.
